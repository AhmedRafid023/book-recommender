# 📚 Book Recommender

A machine learning-powered book recommendation system utilizing metadata from thousands of books. This project leverages natural language processing (NLP) and modern AI techniques to suggest books based on user preferences.

## 📂 Dataset
We use a comprehensive dataset containing metadata for 7,000+ books, sourced from Kaggle:
[7K Books with Metadata](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dylanjcastillo/7k-books-with-metadata)

## 🛠 Installation
To set up the project, ensure you have Python installed, then install the required dependencies:

```sh
pip install kagglehub numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn langchain-openai \
            langchain-huggingface langchain-community langchain-chroma gradio \
            transformers notebook ipywidgets
```

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- **Data Processing:** `numpy`, `pandas`
- **Visualization:** `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- **AI & NLP:** `transformers` (from Hugging Face), `langchain-openai`, `langchain-gemini`
- **Database for Storage:** `langchain-chroma`
- **Interactive UI:** `gradio`
- **Notebook Support:** `notebook`, `ipywidgets`

## 🚀 Features
- 📖 **Personalized Book Recommendations** based on metadata and AI-driven insights
- 🔍 **Search and Filter Books** using natural language queries
